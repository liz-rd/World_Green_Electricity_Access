# World_Green_Electricity_Access
This project was originally presented at Kennesaw State University's Fall 2023 Analyics Day, hosted by the Collage of Software Engineering and Computing. 
It was supported and guided by Austin Brown, PHD. The two datasets used to create the project dataset were from the World Bank data archive and a respectivally linked below.

Access to electricity (% of population):

Rewewable electricity output (% of total electricity output):

This project is an exploratory time series analysis of global access to renewable energy by geographic region over a 15 year timeframe.
The goal was to get an accurate account of the change in access to renewable by looking at the percentage of electricity output while accounting for the areas without any electricity access. 
This adjustment is small, but often overlooked in other research and analysis of renewable energy on a global scale. 

The data cleaning, analysis and visualizations were all conducted in R using a variety of R packages. 
The finalized visualizations, as well as written analysis are on the digital poster (the .pptx file).
